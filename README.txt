Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Look, it's rock, paper, scissors, alright?

To play the game:
1. Clone directory to folder of choice.
2. Type 'make program' into cmd within directory to load onto a UCFK4.
3. The display will show you your current hand. Initially, an X will be displayed to show that you haven't picked anything yet.
4. To select a hand, use the navswitch. Relative to the USB port, north is paper, east is scissors, and south is rock. Your input will show on the display.
5. You can toggle your display on and off to hide your input form the other player by pushing the navswitch inwards; you may still select a hand while your display is hidden.
6. Once you've decided on your hand, push the button to send it to your opponent. The LED will fire to signal you've sent your hand.
7. Once both players have sent their hands, the display will display the result of the game: Win, Loss, or Draw. The winner's LED will fire.
8. To reset the game and return to step 3, press the button again.
